### Description

A take on @hrbrmstr's pew pew map, this is slightly modified to simulate a pathogen spreading.  Spread probabilities are taken from world migration numbers.

### Commands
'nofx' may be set 'true' to turn off sound effects (default 'false')
'noarc' may be set 'true' to turn off the line arc between infections (default 'false')
